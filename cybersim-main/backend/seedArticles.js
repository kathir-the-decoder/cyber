    description: "Learn the basics of SQL injection attacks and how they work",
    content: `# Introduction to SQL Injection

SQL injection is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. It occurs when user input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

## How SQL Injection Works

When a web application takes user input and directly concatenates it into a SQL query without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.

## Example Vulnerable Code

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\${userInput}' AND password = '\${password}'
\`\`\`

## Common Payloads

- \`' OR '1'='1\` - Always true condition
- \`'; DROP TABLE users; --\` - Destructive payload
- \`' UNION SELECT * FROM sensitive_table --\` - Data extraction

## Prevention

1. Use parameterized queries
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. Principle of least privilege
4. Regular security testing

    difficulty: "beginner",
    description: "Understanding XSS vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques",
    content: `# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Fundamentals

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites.

## Types of XSS

### Reflected XSS
User input is immediately reflected back in the response without proper sanitization.

### Stored XSS
Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the target server and served to users.

### DOM-based XSS
The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

## Common XSS Payloads

\`\`\`javascript
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
\`\`\`

## Impact

- Session hijacking
- Credential theft
- Defacement
- Malware distribution

## Prevention

1. Input validation and output encoding
2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
3. HTTPOnly cookies
4. Regular security testing

    category: "attack",
    difficulty: "intermediate",
    description: "Learn how to exploit command injection vulnerabilities",
    content: `# Command Injection Attacks

Command injection occurs when user input is passed to system commands without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

## How Command Injection Works

Applications that execute system commands based on user input are vulnerable if input isn't properly validated.

## Common Injection Points

- File upload functionality
- System administration interfaces
- Network diagnostic tools
- Image processing applications

## Command Separators

\`\`\`bash
; - Execute commands sequentially
&& - Execute if previous command succeeds
|| - Execute if previous command fails
| - Pipe output to next command
\`\`\`

## Example Payloads

\`\`\`bash
127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd
127.0.0.1 && whoami
127.0.0.1 | ls -la
\`\`\`

## Prevention

1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Use safe APIs instead of system commands
3. Principle of least privilege
4. Sandboxing and containerization

    description: "Exploiting path traversal to access unauthorized files",
    content: `# Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities

Directory traversal (path traversal) allows attackers to access files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths.

## How Directory Traversal Works

Applications that use user input to construct file paths without proper validation are vulnerable to path manipulation.

## Common Traversal Sequences

\`\`\`
../ - Standard Unix traversal
..\\ - Windows traversal
%2e%2e%2f - URL encoded traversal
....// - Double encoding bypass
\`\`\`

## Target Files

Common files attackers target:
- \`/etc/passwd\` - Unix user accounts
- \`/etc/shadow\` - Password hashes
- \`../config.php\` - Configuration files
- \`../../../flag.txt\` - Challenge flags

## Example Payloads

\`\`\`
../../../etc/passwd
..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
\`\`\`

## Prevention

1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Use whitelists for allowed files
3. Implement proper access controls
4. Use secure file APIs
